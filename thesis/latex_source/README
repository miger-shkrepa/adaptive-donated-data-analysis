This template uses the CSSHThesis class for all layout settings.
Do not touch the file CSSHThesis.cls!
You can make personal configurations within the template.tex file.

Be aware of the line "\overfullrule=2cm ". 
This shows a black box at the end a line that exceeds the textwidth
and indicates you should either add a hypenation to the section above this line,
or otherwise change something else to comply with the textwidth. 
Be sure to uncomment this line before compiling your final version, 
since often in the bibliography section some citations exceed the
text limit as well. 

The template requires the installation of following additional packages:
* biblatex (for the bibliography backend)
* texlive-latex-extra 
* texlive-fonts-extra
